<h2 style="text-align: center;">Some Food I've Eaten in 2024!</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Fogo de Ch達o<br><span> &#x1f4cc; Irvine Spectrum </span> </h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">I went to Fogo de Ch達o with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day this year and we opted to get the full steak-focused churrasco dining experience! For those unaware, Brazilian Steakhouses such as Fogo de Ch達o have a unique dining dining experience in which employees walk around with sticks of meat and cut slices of various meat on your command. While I think it is worth going once or twice for a special event or overall experience, I don't think I would go back otherwise.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: green">Pros:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">+ Good for those with big appetites, it's all you can eat:)<br> + Decent quality of meat with my favorite being the Picanha<br>+ Excellent selection of sides which included P達o de queijo (known as "cheese bread"), selections of cured meats, salad bar, mashed potatoes, and a Market Place table (be careful though, it takes away from how much meat you can eat!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: red">Cons:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">- Subpar service (maybe because it was a holiday?) Since your meal depends on them serving you an endless amount, if they only come every 30 minutes you might still be very hungry!<br>- Can be pricey for what you're getting, total bill including tip & tax was $190!</p>

<br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Memory Look Cafe<br><span> &#x1f4cc; Downtown Los Angeles </span> </h3>
<p style="text-align:center;" <span> &#x1F31F;&#x1F31F;&#x1F31F;&#x1F31F;/5 </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I went to Memory Look Cafe after seeing it all over TikTok! I really enjoy trying new cafes and getting matcha lattes. I also like my drinks really creamy so I enjoyed the selection of eispanner lattes, lattes with a cream foam on top. The outside and inside aesthetic was really nice as well. The drink was perfectly balanced with a good matcha flavour. Parking can be very difficult in Downtown LA but I would definitely come again!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: green">Pros:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">+ Great if you like your drinks creamy, sweet, but still with great flavour<br>+ Lots of room to socialize with friends or get work done<br>+ Close to restaurants, USC, and other things to do</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: red">Cons:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">- There's a parking lot but I've experienced times where the security guards haven't let us park there. Surrounding parking is available but more of a hassle<br>- Drinks are on the pricier side, ~$7.50 + tax for einspanner<br>- Can be busy on the weekends with long lines!</p>
